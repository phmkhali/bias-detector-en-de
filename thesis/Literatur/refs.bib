  abstract = {Implicit gender bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well-documented problem, and implications of gender introduced into automatic translations can perpetuate real-world biases. However, some LLMs use heuristics or postprocessing to mask such bias, making investigation difficult. Here, we examine bias in LLMs via back-translation, using the DeepL translation API to investigate the bias evinced when repeatedly translating a set of 56 Software Engineering tasks used in a previous study. Each statement starts with `she', and is translated first into a `genderless' intermediate language then back into English; we then examine pronoun-choice in the backtranslated texts. We expand prior research in the following ways: (1) by comparing results across five intermediate languages, namely Finnish, Indonesian, Estonian, Turkish and Hungarian; (2) by proposing a novel metric for assessing the variation in gender implied in the repeated translations, avoiding the overinterpretation of individual pronouns, apparent in earlier work; (3) by investigating sentence features that drive bias; (4) and by comparing results from three time-lapsed datasets to establish the reproducibility of the approach. We found that some languages display similar patterns of pronoun use, falling into three loose groups, but that patterns vary between groups; this underlines the need to work with multiple languages. We also identify the main verb appearing in a sentence as a likely significant driver of implied gender in the translations. Moreover, we see a good level of replicability in the results, and establish that our variation metric proves robust despite an obvious change in the behaviour of the DeepL translation API during the course of the study. These results show that the back-translation method can provide further insights into bias in language models.},

The authors demonstrate that even embeddings trained on seemingly neutral data, like Google News articles, exhibit disturbing gender stereotypes, such as associating "computer programmer" more closely with "man" and "homemaker" with "woman". Recognizing the potential for these biases to be amplified in downstream applications, the paper's main purpose is to develop methodologies to reduce or remove these gender stereotypes from word embeddings. The authors propose and evaluate algorithms that can "debias" the embeddings, aiming to create more equitable representations of language while preserving their usefulness for tasks like analogy solving and semantic understanding.},

Especially for gender-related topics, the need for a system that reduces the model bias has grown in areas such as image captioning, content recommendation, and automated employment. However, detection and evaluation of gender bias in the machine translation systems are not yet thoroughly investigated, for the task being cross-lingual and challenging to define. In this paper, we propose a scheme for making up a test set that evaluates the gender bias in a machine translation system, with Korean, a language with genderneutral pronouns. Three word/phrase sets are primarily constructed, each incorporating positive/negative expressions or occupations; all the terms are gender-independent or at least not biased to one side severely. Then, additional sentence lists are constructed concerning formality of the pronouns and politeness of the sentences. With the generated sentence set of size 4,236 in total, we evaluate gender bias in conventional machine translation systems utilizing the proposed measure, which is termed here as translation gender bias index (TGBI). The corpus and the code for evaluation is available on-line1.},

Translating from English into German poses an interesting case---in German, personreferring nouns are usually gender-specific, and if the gender of the referent(s) is unknown or diverse, the generic masculine (die Studenten (m.)) is commonly used. This solution, however, reduces the visibility of other genders, such as women and non-binary people. To counteract gender discrimination, a societal movement towards using gender-fair language exists (e.g., by adopting neosystems). However, gender-fair German is currently barely supported in machine translation (MT), requiring post-editing or manual translations. We address this research gap by studying gender-fair language in English-to-German MT. Concretely, we enrich a community-created gender-fair language dictionary and sample multi-sentence test instances from encyclopedic text and parliamentary speeches. Using these novel resources, we conduct the first benchmark study involving two commercial systems and six neural MT models for translating words in isolation and natural contexts across two domains. Our findings show that most systems produce mainly masculine forms and rarely genderneutral variants, highlighting the need for future research.

  abstract = {Due to the globalization trend and knowledge boost in the second millennium, multi-lingual translation has become a noteworthy issue. For the purposes of learning knowledge in academic fields, Machine Translation (MT) should be noticed not only academically but also practically. MT should be informed to the translating learners because it is a valuable approach to apply by professional translators for diverse professional fields. For learning translating skills and finding a way to learn and teach through bi-lingual/multilingual translating functions in software, machine translation is an ideal approach that translation trainers, translation learners, and professional translators should be familiar with. In fact, theories for machine translation and computer assistance had been highly valued by many scholars. (e.g., Hutchines, 2003; Thriveni, 2002) Based on MIT's Open Courseware into Chinese that Lee, Lin and Bonk (2007) have introduced, this paper demonstrates how MT can be efficiently applied as a superior way of teaching and learning. This article predicts the translated courses utilizing MT for residents of global village should emerge and be provided soon in industrialized nations and it exhibits an overview about what the current developmental status of MT is, why the MT should be fully applied for academic purpose, such as translating a textbook or teaching and learning a course, and what types of software can be successfully applied. It implies MT should be promoted in Taiwan because its functions of clearly translating the key-words and leading the basic learners to a certain professional field can be proved in MIT.},

By observing the behaviour of finetuning, instruction-tuning, prompting and incontext learning on 7 language models, we identify such performance break-even points across 8 representative text classification tasks of varying characteristics. We show that the specialised models often need only few samples (on average 10 - 1000) to be on par or better than the general ones. At the same time, the number of required labels strongly depends on the dataset or task characteristics, with this number being significantly lower on multi-class datasets (up to 100) than on binary datasets (up to 5000). When performance variance is taken into consideration, the number of required labels increases on average by 100 - 200\% and even up to 1500\% in specific cases.},

  abstract = {Gender-neutral language reflects societal and linguistic shifts towards greater inclusivity by avoiding the implication that one gender is the norm over others. This is particularly relevant for grammatical gender languages, which heavily encode the gender of terms for human referents and over-relies on masculine forms, even when gender is unspecified or irrelevant. Language technologies are known to mirror these inequalities, being affected by a male bias and perpetuating stereotypical associations when translating into languages with extensive gendered morphology. In such cases, genderneutral language can help avoid undue binary assumptions. However, despite its importance for creating fairer multi- and cross-lingual technologies, inclusive language research remains scarce and insufficiently supported in current resources. To address this gap, we present the multilingual mGeNTe dataset. Derived from the bilingual GeNTE (Piergentili et al., 2023b), mGeNTE extends the original corpus to include the English-Italian/German/Spanish language pairs. Since each language pair is Englishaligned with gendered and neutral sentences in the target languages, mGeNTE enables research in both automatic Gender-Neutral Translation (GNT) and language modelling for three grammatical gender languages.},

  abstract = {Gender bias in machine translation (MT) is recognized as an issue that can harm people and society. And yet, advancements in the field rarely involve people, the final MT users, or inform how they might be impacted by biased technologies. Current evaluations are often restricted to automatic methods, which offer an opaque estimate of what the downstream impact of gender disparities might be. We conduct an extensive human-centered study to examine if and to what extent bias in MT brings harms with tangible costs, such as quality of service gaps across women and men. To this aim, we collect behavioral data from {$\sim$}90 participants, who post-edited MT outputs to ensure correct gender translation. Across multiple datasets, languages, and types of users, our study shows that feminine post-editing demands significantly more technical and temporal effort, also corresponding to higher financial costs. Existing bias measurements, however, fail to reflect the found disparities. Our findings advocate for human-centered approaches that can inform the societal impact of bias.},

Such findings run counter the traditional assumption of masculine generic forms to be gender-neutral and are the cause of debates within and outside the linguistic community. The present paper aims to explore the semantics of masculine generics by implementing ideas of discriminative learning; an approach that thus far has not yet been used in this matter. If the present results account for a male bias of the masculine generic, findings by previous studies, which relied on very different methodological approaches, are confirmed. Indeed, it is found that masculine generics are semantically much more similar to masculine explicits than to feminine explicits. This supports the notion of a male bias in masculine generics.},

In response to this shortage, in this tutorial, I provide practical guidance for both students and researchers in the IS community who want to methodologically conduct qualitative literature reviews. The tutorial differs from other instructional texts in two regards. First, in contrast to most textbooks, I cover not only searching and synthesizing the literature but also the challenging tasks of framing the literature review, interpreting research findings, and proposing research paths. Second, I draw on other texts that provide guidelines for writing literature reviews in the IS discipline but use many examples of published literature reviews. I use an integrated example of a literature review, which guides the reader through the overall process of compiling a literature review.},

In this article, we evaluate potential gender biases of commercial image recognition platforms using photographs of U.S. members of Congress and a large number of Twitter images posted by these politicians. Our crowdsourced validation shows that commercial image recognition systems can produce labels that are correct and biased at the same time as they selectively report a subset of many possible true labels. We find that images of women received three times more annotations related to physical appearance. Moreover, women in images are recognized at substantially lower rates in comparison with men. We discuss how encoded biases such as these affect the visibility of women, reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, and limit the validity of the insights that can be gathered from such data.},

Two principle strategies have been employed to make languages gender-fair and to treat women and men symmetrically: neutralization and feminization. Neutralization is achieved, for example, by replacing male-masculine forms (policeman) with genderunmarked forms (police officer), whereas feminization relies on the use of feminine forms to make female referents visible (i.e., the applicant... he or she instead of the applicant... he). By integrating research on (1) language structures, (2) language policies, and (3) individual language behavior, we provide a critical review of how GFL contributes to the reduction of gender stereotyping and discrimination. Our review provides a basis for future research and for scientifically based policy-making.},

Recently, many of these systems are found to inherit and propagate gender and racial biases that disadvantages the minority population.

Through a detailed analysis of               N               = 120 papers, we map the current research landscape on gender specific biases present in ML and AI assisted automated systems. We further point out the aspects of ML/AI gender biases research that are less explored and require more attention. Mainly we focus on the lack of user studies and inclusivity in this field of study. We also shed some light into the gender bias issue as experienced by the algorithm designers. In conclusion, in this paper we provide a holistic view of the breadth of studies conducted in the field of exploring, detecting and mitigating gender biases in ML and AI systems and, a future direction for the studies to take in order to provide a fair and accessible ML and AI systems to all users.},

However, as the utilisation of these tools growth, so does the risk of unexpected consequences due to the presence of bias. This study investigates the presence of gender bias within the most popular neural machine translation and large language model tools. We defined a set of Italian sentences concerning ten specific jobs, where the gender of the subjects is not explicitly mentioned. Employing those AI tools, we translated the sentences from Italian to English, requiring the gender to be explicitly mentioned. Afterwards, we developed a survey to obtain human translations for the same sentences, allowing us to compare the differences between the responses generated by the tools and those from individuals. Results show a high presence of gender bias especially for the jobs associated with a male gender and demonstrate a consistency between the outcome obtained by the tools and the results of the survey. These findings serve as a starting point for exploring the origins of gender bias within natural language processing tools and how they reflect gender distributions in our society and human behaviour regarding job occupations.},

By generating a gendered language dataset using these LLMs, focusing on sentences about men and women, we analyze the extent of gender bias in their outputs. Our evaluation is two-fold: we use the generated dataset to train a gender stereotype detection task and measure gender bias in the classifier, and we perform a comprehensive analysis of the LLM-generated text at both the sentence and word levels. Gender bias evaluations in classification tasks and lexical content reveal that all the LLMs demonstrate significant gender bias. ChatGPT 4 and Llama 2 13B exhibit the least gender bias, with weak associations between gendered adjectives used and the gender of the person described in the sentence. In contrast, ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama 2 7B exhibit the most gender bias, showing strong associations between the gendered adjectives used and the gender of the person described in the sentence.},

In this paper, we present a survey of 304 papers on gender bias in natural language processing. We analyse definitions of gender and its categories within social sciences and connect them to formal definitions of gender bias in NLP research. We survey lexica and datasets applied in research on gender bias and then compare and contrast approaches to detecting and mitigating gender bias. We find that research on gender bias suffers from four core limitations. 1) Most research treats gender as a binary variable neglecting its fluidity and continuity. 2) Most of the work has been conducted in monolingual setups for English or other high-resource languages. 3) Despite a myriad of papers on gender bias in NLP methods, we find that most of the newly developed algorithms do not test their models for bias and disregard possible ethical considerations of their work. 4) Finally, methodologies developed in this line of research are fundamentally flawed covering very limited definitions of gender bias and lacking evaluation baselines and pipelines. We see overcoming these limitations as a necessary development in future research.
