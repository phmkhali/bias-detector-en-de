Recent years have seen extensive research on bias in MT. A systematic review of the literature by \citeauthor{shresthaExploringGenderBiases2022} offers a thorough overview of this issue, detailing its scope, impact, and key findings relevant to my thesis. Several case studies comparing English to both grammatical-gender languages (e.g., Spanish, Italian) and non-gender-marking languages (e.g., Hungarian) consistently identify biases, including the assignment of stereotypical gender roles and a default tendency to use male pronouns \cite{stanovskyEvaluatingGenderBias2019,pratesAssessingGenderBias2019,smacchiaDoesAIReflect2024}. The methodologies used in these studies will be valuable for my own implementation. Lastly, the study by \citeauthor{lardelliBuildingBridgesDataset2024} on the challenges of translating English into German lays the foundation for my analysis. It provides data for testing the translation of gender-neutral terms in context, as well as a gender-fair German dictionary, both of which I can build upon.

This is a statement \citep{barclayInvestigatingMarkersDrivers2024}.
\citet{lardelliBuildingBridgesDataset2024} found evidence.
