\chapter*{Declaration of Independent Work}

\noindent I hereby declare that I have written this thesis independently and have not used any sources or aids other than those indicated. The thesis has not been submitted in the same or similar form for any other examination. All verbatim or paraphrased passages, as well as any sections created, written, or edited with the help of AI-based tools, are clearly marked and cited. In the appendix of my thesis, I have listed all AI-based tools used, including product names and the prompts I employed, in an AI tools directory. I confirm that I have not used any AI-based tools whose use was explicitly prohibited by the examiner. I am aware that content generated by AI-based tools does not guarantee its quality. I take full responsibility for any machine-generated passages I have included and accept responsibility for any errors, distorted content, incorrect references, violations of data protection or copyright, or plagiarism resulting from the use of AI-generated content.
