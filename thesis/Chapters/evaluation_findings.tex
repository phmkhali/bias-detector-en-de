\chapter{Evaluation and Findings}
\section{Model Performance}
%  restate the key metrics (do not explain )
%  interpreting what the values mean
% trade-offs or unexpected values

\section{Test Results}
% summarize results across datasets or splits
% patterns or trends in the numbers.
% eg performance on handcrafted data is lower, likely due to its lexical variation..
% mark any generalizability or consistency issues

\section{Error Analysis}
% describe typical failure types, eg the model struggles with detecting subtle lexical bias but catches inserted pronouns reliably
% group errors by type (refer to manual test set creation)
% how serious or frequent each error type is.
    \subsection{Sample Cases}
    % concrete examples of wrong and correct bias flags
